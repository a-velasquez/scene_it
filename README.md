# Scene It - A Sinatra App

### Introduction

```scene_it``` is a Sinatra app that can be used to keep track of the movies you've seen. We've all had that moment when we can't remember if we've seen a movie and whether we liked it or not. With ```scene-it``` you can sign up for an account and add a movie to your collection with a ```title:```, ```genre:```, ```release_date:```, ```description:```, and a personal ```rating:``` out of 5 stars.  

### Installing

After checking out the repo, clone it, run ```bundle install``` to install Ruby gem dependencies, then use ```shotgun``` to start up your server.

### Usage

 Users can create, read update and delete a movie from their collection.
 
```scene_it``` uses an MVC structure with 2 models:

 ###### 1. User: ```username:```, ```email:```, and ```password```.
 ###### 2. Movie: ```title:```, ```genre:```, ```release_date:```, ```description:```, and ```rating:```.
